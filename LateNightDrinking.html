                            <span> Late Night Dinks is a video game version of excisting board drinking game
                                that my
                                friend made. We just wanted to make the board game playable at discord game nights so
                                everyone can
                                drink at their homes. The orignial idea was to make it so one person streams it and
                                plays it
                                for ohters
                                so it kinda works like the board game but then i just wanted to make it online game so
                                everyone can throw the dice
                                so it feels more like you are playing it not just watching a stream telling you what to
                                do.
                                <br> <br>
                                I'm doing all the coding to the game since i have experience in making online games,
                                while
                                Mea, the person
                                who made the board game and owns it is doing all the graphics. Basicly its a fun little
                                project that lets me get needed prjoect Hours
                                and she gets to do and learn moddeling and add everything she wants to the bulding the
                                game
                                is setting in.
                                <br> <br>
                                For the Networking i am using photon v2. I know there is new versions of photon and i
                                might
                                switch it up but when we started this project photon did not yet have
                                the two versions out. Other than that the game is made in unity 2021.3.16f1 version.
                                <br> <br>
                                What have I done for the game: <br>
                                First I made 1 player prototype of the game where press the space bar and the game
                                throws
                                thsi gigant dice that is using raycasting to the groud
                                to know wich side the dice is lading on and giving the opposite number as the number you
                                character will move. After that the character will move after waypoints
                                moving for the corrent mount and maximum of six waypoints at the time. After the
                                movement
                                the game will pop out UI text to tell what promt the player got
                                to do for their turn. The protytpe was set to be this apartment building or hotel kinda
                                building and you start at the top and make your self go down bit by bit
                                to make it to the front door and leave for the night life. I made simple looking house
                                to
                                mimic this with unity assets and later Mea modeled real building for us.

                                        After the prototype I started making the main menu and lobby system with photon
                                        so
                                        playes
                                        can connect to the same room and start playing together. as of 11.9.2023 the
                                        game
                                        names
                                        ur
                                        self as känniääliö
                                        and random 4 numbers and you can connect to the same lobby and start viewing the
                                        prototype
                                        togheter. So main menu's core is done.
                                        <br><br>
                                        The gameplay is right now on the works. The game as of 11.9.2023 has only one
                                        character
                                        spawned and moving but its syncinc to every player who connects to the lobby and
                                        gets
                                        in game. Also the dice movement and camera is also working for the dice right
                                        now.
                                        Now i
                                        need to spawn multiple characters that are asignd to diffent players and make
